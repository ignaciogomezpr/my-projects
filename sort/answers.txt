sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm scales as a O(n^2) when tasked with sorting random data sets, which means it's either a Merge Sort or a Bubble Sort.  When tasked with sorting sorted and reversed ordered data sets, this algorithms took substantially more time when sorting large reversed data sets.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm is substantially faster than the other two algorithms, and scales as a O(logn).

sort3 uses: Select Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm scales as a O(n^2) when tasked with sorting random data sets, which means it's either a Merge Sort or a Bubble Sort.  When tasked with sorting sorted and reversed ordered data sets, this algorithms took less time than sort1 time when sorting large reversed data sets.
