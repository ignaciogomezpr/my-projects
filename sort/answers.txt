sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) when tasked with sorting random data sets, which means it's either Selection Sort or a Bubble Sort.  When tasked with sorting sorted and reversed ordered data sets, this algorithms took substantially more time than sort3 when sorting large reversed data sets.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm is substantially faster than the other two algorithms, and its time complexity is of O(nlogn).

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) when tasked with sorting random data sets, which means it's either Selection Sort or a Bubble Sort.  When tasked with sorting sorted and reversed ordered data sets, this algorithms took less time than sort1 time while sorting large reversed data sets.
